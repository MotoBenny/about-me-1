<p> Hello, My name is Anthony. Im 32. I'm a junior full stack developer currently enrolled at code fellows. The reason I joined code fellows at this stage in my life was due to me being miserable in my last career field. I loved satellite communications at one point but at some point I began to hate it. I've always been interested in how coding worked. So after finding out that I could use my GI bill  to pay for my classes. I decided to go this route for boot camp. I have 5 kids (3 boys, 2 girls) My oldest is 13 and my youngest are 5 (I had twins this last go round)
